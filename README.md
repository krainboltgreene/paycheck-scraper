# paycheck-scraper


I wrote a python script to scrape a folder of HTML files for my online [paycheck records](https://www.paycheckrecords.com), extract the right data I wanted, and then output the data into a CSV file. 

_Because #taxes_

	Disclaimer: anything found in the /sample folder is FAKE data! It's there to show you that the script works.


### To use the sample

`python sample.py`
